# Elecronic-Door-Lock
This project is a smart door lock system built with an Arduino, 4x4 keypad, servo motor, and I2C LCD display. Users can unlock the door by entering a predefined password using the keypad. If the password is correct, the door (servo motor) opens; otherwise, it locks and shows an error message with a retry countdown.
